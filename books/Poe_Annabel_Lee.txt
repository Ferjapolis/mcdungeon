Edgar Allan Poe
Annabel Lee
It was many and many a year ago,\n   In a kingdom by the sea,\nThat a maiden there lived whom you may know\n   By the name of ANNABEL LEE;--\nAnd this maiden she lived with no other thought
   Than to love and be loved by me.\nShe was a child and I was a child,\n   In this kingdom by the sea,\nBut we loved with a love that was more than love--\n   I and my Annabel Lee--
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven\n   Coveted her and me.\nAnd this was the reason that, long ago,\n   In this kingdom by the sea,\nA wind blew out of a cloud by night\n   Chilling my Annabel Lee;
So that her high-born kinsman came\n   And bore her away from me,\nTo shut her up in a sepulchre\n   In this kingdom by the sea.\nThe angels, not half so happy in Heaven,\n   Went envying her and me:--
Yes! that was the reason (as all men know,\n   In this kingdom by the sea)\nThat the wind came out of a cloud, chilling\n   And killing my Annabel Lee.\nBut our love it was stronger by far than the love
   Of those who were older than we--\n   Of many far wiser than we-\nAnd neither the angels in Heaven above,\n   Nor the demons down under the sea,\nCan ever dissever my soul from the soul\n   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee:--
\nFor the moon never beams without bringing me dreams\n   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;\nAnd the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes\n   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;\nAnd so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride,\n   In her sepulchre there by the sea--\n   In her tomb by the side of the sea.
